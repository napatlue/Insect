function [alln, allmean, allstd] = overallmeanstd(grpn, grpmean, grpstd)
% [alln, allmean, allstd] = overallmeanstd(grpn, grpmean, grpstd)
% calculates the overall number of observations (alln), the mean (allmean)
% and standard deviation (allstd) of multiple groups with given number of 
% observations (grpn), mean values (grpmean) and standard deviations 
% (grpstd) for each group
% this is usefull if you don't have your observations stored anymore or
% you have a really high number of observations
% solution comes from ...
