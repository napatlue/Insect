1. makefile:
   type 'make' to compile and run demo classification program
   type 'make paper.pdf' to compile latex report  (You must have pdflatex installed)
                         or you can use the complied pdf (826report.pdf) under DOC dir.
   type 'make clean' to remove temp files.

2. find_outlier.m
   Param path: path that contains wav files that outliers are to be checked.
   Param k: k neighbours (We are using LOF algorithm)

3. plot_class_fft.m
