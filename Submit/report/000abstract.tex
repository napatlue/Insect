In this project, we develop a new fast and effective way of measuring the similarity between two short sound clips. Our goal is to develop a new distance function for one nearest neighbor classifier from dataset of 1100 sound clips of 11 insect classes to predict future unseen dataset with more accuracy than any current standard distance function. We also focus on visualization part to detect any patterns among the insect sound using SVD, MDS and FastMap. Lastly we implement Local Outlier Factor(LOF) alogorithm to detect the outliers(not insect sound). We successfully develop distance function that perform better than standard distance function like Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. We also able detect 4 outliers among the several hundreds sound clips.
