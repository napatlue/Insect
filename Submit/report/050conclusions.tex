The proposed method to use features in frequency domain and combine with distance in time domain has the following advantages:
\bit
\item it gives better classification accuracy than all of the methods we have tried
\item its accuracy is better than all standard distance function
\item it is scalable as it scale linearly with data.
\eit

The below table show the Error rate (1-accuracy) of all methods we've tried
